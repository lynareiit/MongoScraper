# MongoScraper

MongoScraper is my Week 19 homework assignment for the UC Berekely Coding Boot Camp. It is an application tat scrapes data of articles from CNN News, then stores then in a list to be displayed. When an article is clicked, the user is then directed to the article page. Extra capabilities allow for the user to add notes, save articles for later, and delete it from the list.
